#Goals.

# Introduction #

This project started to play around with new approachs to customize alfresco and deliver disruptive WEB 2.0 applications.

We've been digesting the alfresco concepts and approaches for content management, and the suitability to provide a flexible infrastructure to store and manipulate web resources that can be used both by the humans or machines.

Alfresco provides a nice set of features that will allow us to create a good architecture for new generation web 2.0 applications. Out-of-the-box, Alfresco content repository provide us with:
  * Content transformation
  * Content versioning
  * Auditing
  * Open Search
  * And more... (see http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Content_Repository)

Alfresco is built on top of Open Source and can be customized via a REST architecture. (http://wiki.alfresco.com/wiki/Web_Scripts_Examples)

For the REST we will frame our work around Fielding's Dissertation, chapter 5 - http://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm

We will play around with restlet (http://www.restlet.org/), GWT (http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/), Alfresco (http://www.alfresco.org), Jetty, Maven and more you would like to. We can even have a more functional REST framework developed in scala :)

And to eat our own dog food, we will build a WEB 2.0 Application to **really** help scrum enabled organizations. This application that will provides us with the insights and knowledge about new software paradigms. This new knowledge can be applied to the business, of course.

# Details #

This will be a challenge to some of you (me included) that are used to the traditional n-tier architectures and the distribution of concerns around these n tiers.

We can't say now if REST architectures are better that the n-tier architectures, or if they are even suitable for enterprise applications, however we will find out with research and experimentations.

## Technology goal ##

Research and develop new software technology that can be used in the context of enterprise and critical-mission applications.
