Getting started

= Introduction =
We'll go here through the basic steps to getting started in windows xp.

What you'll need: (TODO: Add links)

   * JDK1.5+ {TODO. Add link]
   * Maven 2+ [TODO: Check version and add link how to install]
   * Eclipse 3.4 
   * Alfresco Labs 3.0 (See here details for installation [TODO: Add link])

Assumptions:
   * You have Alfresco Labs 3.0 configured and running.
   
== First steps==

Checkout the folder scrumr from SVN (http://code.google.com/p/alface/source/checkout) to your local disk. 

== WebClient ==

   * go to the SCRUM_HOME/webclient, where SCRUM_HOME is where you have your working copy of the project
   * run the command to check if everything is ok:
{{{
mvn compile
}}} 
   * run the following commands if you wish to generate and eclipse project
{{{ 
mvn eclipse:eclipse
}}}
   * Run the following command to create a lunch configuration so you can run the GWT shel from eclipse:
{{{
mvn gwt:eclipse
}}}
   * In eclipse import-> Existing Projects into Workspace -> Select the folder SCRUM_HOME/webclient
   * Locate the file org.nideasystems.scrumr.webclient.Application.launch
   * Right click and Run as...

if you don't see the GWT shell, or if the shell is empty, something is wrong :)

== Restlayer ==
   * go to SCRUM_HOME/restlayer
   * run the following command to test if everything is ok:
{{{
mvn jetty:run
}}}
   * go to your browser, and type: http://localhost:8082/

You have started the jetty web server listening in port 8082.

   * You're promped with a username/password. Use some valid username/password from Alfresco

If everything it's ok you should a string in your browser

   * To generate the eclipse project, run the following command:
{{{
mvn eclipse:eclipse
}}}
   * Follow the same steps describe above fro webclient
   * Locate the Class org.nideasystems.scrumr.restlayer.Server
   * Right click and Run as... Java application
   * http://localhost:8181/

If everything it's ok you should be asked again for the username/passwod :)

Turn your refactoring on :)
